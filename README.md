# Covid-19-in-India-Dashboard
<br><br>
## INTRODUCTION
* Welcome to our project on Covid-19 in India Dashboard Analysis Tableau visualization!
* In this project, we will explore the power of Tableau to create compelling visualizations
Dashboard and insights from data.
* Tableau is a data visualization tool that allows us to create interactive and dynamic
dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps. With Tableau, we can explore and analyze large
datasets, identify patterns and trends, and communicate our findings effectively.
* In this project, we will be using Tableau to create visualizations for a specific dataset or
scenario. We will start by understanding the dataset and the questions we want to answer.
Then, we will use Tableau to create visualizations that help us answer these questions and
gain insights from the data. We will also explore different features of Tableau, such as
filters, calculated fields, and mapping, to create more complex visualizations and gain
deeper insights.
* Throughout this project, we will start by understanding the dataset or scenario we are
working with and defining the questions we want to answer. We will then use Tableau's
intuitive interface and tools to create a range of visualizations that help us answer these
questions and gain insights from the data.
* As we progress through the project, we will also explore some of Tableau's more advanced
features, such as calculated fields, filters, and mapping, to create even more powerful
visualizations. These features will enable us to gain deeper insights into the data and create
more compelling and informative visualizations.
* This project is based on such data analysis on Covid-19 in India.
* Covid-19 in India Dataset we work with multiple data sources (we will use 7 files in total)
* We use data blending, use shape file to create a map with Tableau, use measure names and
dual axis to create a multiple line chart and many other techniques.
* By the end of this project, we will have gained valuable skills in data visualization, analysis,
and communication that can be applied in a variety of industries and settings. Whether you
are interested in business intelligence, data science, or simply want to improve your data
visualization skills, this project will provide you with an excellent introduction to the power
and versatility of Tableau.
## Scope of the Analysis
